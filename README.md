### Hi!! 👋

🔭 Backend developer at Idealista. Graduated in a Degree equivalent to Computer Science & Computer Engineering from the University of Santiago de Compostela.  I consider myself a sociable person and pro active. 🌱 I am interested in different areas of computer science but above all issues related to the design and development of software, new technologies related to artificial intelligence, as well as human-computer interaction and project management. 

😄 I am always willing to participate in new projects and activities in which I can contribute or learn something. 

🤔 About me and my work: I have developed my Final Undergraduate Project about the generation of reports in natural language about the state of Galician roads and highways.  In addition, I spent a month as a researcher in training at CITUS working on the improvements of this project. I had the opportunity to be part of the "Explorer, young people with ideas" program, an initiative promoted by Santander Bank in which, together with my project colleagues, I received training and advice on entrepreneurship issues. 👯 In addition, I'm co-organizer of the Google Developers Group community of Santiago de Compostela. Also, I am mentor on the program Google Summer of Code 2020.
